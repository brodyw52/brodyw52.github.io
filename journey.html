      <p class="p">
        I started buildat at 14. During Covid, I created and sold instrumental music online, earning roughly $1,000 by learning demand, pricing and distribution the hard way. As a kid I also ran a small eBay operation, selling friends items and taking a 10% margin. Nothing fancy, but real transactions that developed my innate entrepreneurial spirit. At the same time I developed as an advanced piano player, performing diploma-level repertoire (ABRSM 8+ expert). This taught me intense discipline as well as execution under pressure.

      <p class="p">
        I entered college as a varsity soccer player at the NJCAA D3 level, and spent my first two years competing at a high level. A torn ACL abruptly finished that path and created lots of forced downtime. I used this to go all in on AI. I taught myself how to build AI systems and automations, vibe coding and how to move from idea to a working system extremely fast. I spent hours studying tools, reading, listening and experimenting. Next, I shipped: my own AI application, automations for a local startup and unconventional growth systems- automated reddit engagement, deeply personalized cold outreach via Linkedin scraping, and end to end pipelines that I owned outcomes for. I found this work creative, honest and energizing. I then realigned my studies and activities around this found energy.

      <p class="p">
        Today, I’m active in hackathons, entrepreneurship clubs and intern at a venture capital firm. This exposure has sharpened my judgement: I see lots of ideas, few that matter, and even fewer that actually execute. Watching products, teams, and GTM strategies succeed or fail has made it clear where I want to be- on the operating side, building or involved with a fast growing company building systems that make a measurable difference.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        My “why” behind all of this is because I feel that I was put on this earth to create something that creates a difference in others lives. I believe in positivity, connection, authenticity and community, and I do my best work when working with like minded people to win.
